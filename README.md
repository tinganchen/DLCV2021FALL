Deep Learning for Computer Vision

### [hw0. Face recognition with PCA](./hw0)

1. Mean face & eigenfaces
2. Project onto the eigenspace and reconstruct the images
3. Reconstruction error in MSE
4. 3-fold cross-validation + KNN for testing
5. Recognition rate

### [hw1. i. Image classification & ii. Segmentation](./hw1)

i. Image classification
  1. CNN [VGG-16, ResNet-110]
  2. Multi-class problem 
  3. Cross entropy loss
  4. Accuracy
  5. t-SNE for visualizing the classification results

ii. Image segmentation on satellite map
  1. CNN + FCN [VGG-16+FCN32, ResNet-50+FCN]
  2. Multi-class problem (One dimension per pixel)
  3. Cross entropy loss + Dice loss
  4. mIOU
